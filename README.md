# First in... Line?
My submission into PlayJam 5, as well as my first released game! The source code is here for a fun pokey-aroundy, but I can't guarantee anything in here is good practice. (It was made for a jam, after all).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for purchase [here on itch.io](https://stuffbyrae.itch.io/first-in-line). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools and HATE paying money for things, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy!
