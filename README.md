My submission into PlayJam 5. Since it's free, I'm putting up the source code for a fun pokey-aroundy. I can't guarantee anything in here is good practice, though.

If you wanna play this game, it's available [here on itch.io](https://stuffbyrae.itch.io/first-in-line), pay what you want!
Otherwise, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder here, and enjoy!
